            Produce a good content with your creative mind if your<br>
            content is attractive then your insta id is very expensive.<br>

            <h1>Example.3</h1>
           <p>
            Posting regularly is one of the ingredients on how to be an Instagram success. This requires you to be very active. Ideally, you should be posting a least once a day.<br><br>

            If you can post more than that, 2-3 times a day will get you the most reach and engagement, especially to grow your account.<br><br>
            
            While it can be a pain to post several times a day, Sked comes in handy for this and automates your posting.<br><br>
            
            Just set-up your content queue and add the Instagram content. To do this, open your account and click on the ‘Setup queue’ option on the homepage.<br><br>
            <br>
            Next, select your account, enable your queue (see green arrow below), and choose your timezone (red arrow). Then, click the ‘Add’ button for the days you want to post and set the time (blue arrow).<br>

            <h1>Example.4</h1>
           <p>
            Throughout my time managing various Instagram accounts I’ve come across a lot of businesses making silly little mistakes on Instagram that really affects their chance of growth and being an Instagram success.<br><br>

These little mistakes can be anything from using no hashtags to a bunch of random non-related hashtags to even no caption!<br><br>

When sharing content on Instagram, it’s vital you utilise Instagram hashtags. The reason being you will maximise your chances of reach, engagement and potential growth.<br><br>

For all content I share on the platform, I make sure to use up all 30 hashtags – this gives me maximum exposure.<br><br>

I also make sure to do regular in-depth keyword research to find the best hashtags that will give me the chance of being featured in the top nine posts.<br><br>

Instagram hashtag keyword research is very important. If you get it right and manage to rack up a lot of engagement within a short period of posting, you may even hit the explore page.<br><br>

If I were you, I would start doing Instagram hashtag research and then use Sked’s hashtag manager to keep them organised. You can use it to store all your hashtags separately or in groups, which is really handy if have more than one account to manage.<br><br>

It’s much easier than storing them in Evernote and having to copy-paste them all the time. If you haven’t tried hashtag manager yet, take it for a test drive and see what you think.<br><br>

            <h1>Example.5</h1>
            <p>nstagram Stories can be used in various ways. It’s a brilliant feature that should be utilised regularly. Especially when your account surpasses 10,000 followers which enables you to start adding hyperlinks within your stories.<br><br>

                This is a fantastic way to drive more traffic and generate more business from Instagram.<br><br>
                
                You should also create polls on Instagram stories to find out specific information about your followers, for example, what type of content they prefer.<br><br>
                
                Using this feature to announce a new post is also a great strategy, as a result, you will see an increase in engagement much faster.</p><br>
